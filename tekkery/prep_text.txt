friend
amelia’s
saying
“ah

”
held
out
left

towards
expecting
would
quite
confounded
honour
miss
sharp
put
out
right
forefinger
gave
little
nod
cool
killing
rawdon
crawley
watching

could
hardly
restrain
laughter
saw
lieutenant’s
entire
discomfiture
start
gave
pause
perfect
clumsiness

condescended
take
finger
offered
embrace
“she’d
beat

”
captain
said
rapture
lieutenant
way
beginning
conversation
agreeably
asked
rebecca
how
liked
new
place
“my
place
”
said
miss
sharp
coolly
“how

me

tolerably
good

good

wirt’s
believe

”
“why
”
mr
osborne
said
amazed
“why
never
condescended
speak
me
ask
me
into
their
house
whilst
staying
amelia
we
poor
governesses
know
are
used
slights
sort
”
“my
dear
miss
sharp
”
osborne
ejaculated
“at
least
some
families
”
rebecca
continued
“you
can’t
think

”
osborne
quite
savage
little
governess
patronised
persiffled
until
young
british
lion
felt
quite
uneasy
nor
could
muster
sufficient
presence
mind
find
pretext
backing
out
most
delectable
conversation
“i
thought
liked
city
families
pretty
well
”
said
haughtily
“last
year
mean
fresh
horrid
vulgar
school
course
did
doesn’t
every
girl
like

how
know
any
better

”
“it
seems
me
didn’t
dislike

mr

”
osborne
said
kindly
“how

”
mr
osborne
gave
look
much
say
“indeed
how
very
obliging
”
“what

amelia
dear
mr
osborne

how
”
thus
george
utterly
routed
rebecca
right
managed
most
successfully
put
wrong
now
shamefully
fled
feeling
if
stayed
another

would
been

dobbin
certainly
thought

extended
dropped
some
alarm
“deceivers

said
“no

praise

smote
dobbin’s

very
keenly

more
guilty
“sir

“why

“mr

“time

“fast

“sir

“i
